Relevant syscalls:

send - Internally implemented by sendto
send(sockfd, buf, len, flags); is equivalent to sendto(sockfd, buf, len, flags, NULL, 0);

sendto - sends data

recv - Implemented as " __sys_recvfrom(fd, ubuf, size, flags, NULL, NULL);"
recvfrom - Uses sock_recvmsg which uses sock->ops->recvmsg


recvmsg - uses  sock_recvmsg
sendmsg - Similar to the sendto syscall but allows sending additional data via the msg argument.
According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4258834/how-sendmsg-works,
    send, sendto are just wrappers for sendmsg internally. (At least, for 2010)

According to my research, at least in kernel V5.18,
the flow is send -> sendto -> sock_sendmsg -> (sock_ptr->ops->sendmsg())

Here is a study on V3.7.2 https://gist.github.com/yegle/4560621



Note that intenally, there is sock_recvmsg, sock_recvmsg_nosec and etc. Not sure what this nosec does.


Conclusions:
send -> sendto -> sock_sendmsg
recv -> recvfrom -> sock_recvmsg
